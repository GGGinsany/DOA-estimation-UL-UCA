doa_simulation_ul&uca
this repository contains various small projects in matlab.
>ul

this part include the full simulation of doa under uniform linear array. 
the simulation is made under coherent signal model, which include smd,mmd,ss,toeplitz smoothing method.
this simulation also test single channel receiving mathod and made a comparation with multipal channel 
make a recommandation of switching frequency, N and array spacing.

>uca


this part use uca_rb_music algorithm
a combination of spacing-smoothing method and switching model.
